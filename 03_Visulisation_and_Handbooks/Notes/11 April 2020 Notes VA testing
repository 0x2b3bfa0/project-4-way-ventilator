Testing the new panel that Patrick built
all tubes to and from patients and ventilator are on the same side
Materials used in construction:
CPVC (in the EUA)
using PVC for the tubing and valves
Aluminum panel
PETG, Nylon, ASA as the three printed materials

reusing tubing from the last experiment

Goals for the test:
1.  UI is good/form factor
2. test patients going on and off
3. adjust tidal volume
4. test new flow meter (calibrate, comparison to known good
5. Maybe test a third mannequin


circuitboard location-- in the middle, with circuitry on the back
splash potential-- not an issue until changing tubing, then it could be an issue
put the flow meter output on top, not on the side

displays need to be clearly marked, with particular circuits

adapter between 22mm and PVC is a bit loose, needs to be tighter and kept in place
Filters 

One-way valves work; found that out by swapping the one-way valve orientation

PVC not giving; how much flow is going back?

turning off a circuit caused the inspiratory adapter to pop

filters at the top or at the bottom

Pressure control not volume control
Pressure was set at 30, which was too much pressure

Needs a longer time to create the breath, since it has more dead space that it has to fill
**Have to figure out the inspiratory time and expiratory time necessary to keep the vent happy and to fill up the tubing**

flow meter problems

breath to breath, tidal volume varies as much as 50 mLs
460 vs 420 isn't that big of a deal
want some kind of gross control so that we can take 750 down

Manual PEEP valves, but they vent to the environment
all have to have the same PEEP, FiO2, same frequency, sorry

Severe ARDS as flu patients

Wiring is definitely a concern

Software issue with breath detection
lung squeeze technique to determine which patient is getting the most flow

might have a math issue

calibrate by shutting off valves and flowing through one
volume control to calibrate

Ventilator issues?
PEEP valves with Albert's group, collar to prevent dropping to atmosphere

flow rate and tidal volume calculated
set to 500, seeing 487
seeing 357 returning

slack channel: differential multiventilation

FDA waivers
probably a minor leak in each mannequin

much more functional than last time

testing the automotive part

using the anasthesia setup for gas regulation
connect the blood pressure from a catheter into the elbow at the patient's flow
can provide proportional information about which patient is getting more
waveform to see the change between patients

inline PEEP
Everyone who works a vent should know those waveforms
place to describe those pressure waveforms
they change based on the ventilation type used
can be found in any RT textbook or vent textbook
piston ventilators would have non-standard waveforms, not going to a plateau
flow regulator to force the plateau with a piston

Balloons?
reservoir bags on any anesthesia circuit, used pediatric balloons
volume is 1 liter

experimenting with turning a patient prone (face down)
splitting would mean not proning

check valve movement

even with the tubes all separated, still should have labeling
adjusting the valve does adjust the tidal volume
definitely not linear
has more sensitivity than last week

confidence is high we can get it working, but not yet today
happy with the form factor-- would like to see the inline peep valve

messing around with check valve location

for the next version, check out the PEEP options
