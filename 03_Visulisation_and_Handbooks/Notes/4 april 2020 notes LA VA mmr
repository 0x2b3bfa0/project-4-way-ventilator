-- no humidifier needed
-- no nasal cannuli, have to be intubated


2 patients
1 ventilator with humidifier -- Nalcor 840 puritan bennett
push capacity: 

pressure control vs volume control
usually volume control
calibration/test mode

standard setup procedure to make sure everything's properly connected

50 psi coming out of the wall

syringe
laryngoscope

circuit disconnect error


male to female adapter/female to male

calibrate first
a few cycles for the circuit to fill up
multiple flows

356 for the first mannequin

382/388 for the second (now 392)

more about pressure
higher driving pressure in the lungs will be what hurts patients

can take apart tubing to attach for nitric oxide (not nitrous)
used for hypertension

ysplitter right at the ventilator
pivot to ecmo before we go to nitric oxide
adapters are just standard and we should expect hospitals to have them

416 and 450

pressing on the lungs with aa backpack to "siimulate" pneumonia

labels along the tubing

second reader had 350 on the first patient

390 on the second

thinking that there could be a leak in the first mannequin

measure expiratory flow
****need to say which sides are inspiratory and which sides are expiratory****

using gloves when attaching things?  vs no gloves

disconnection is the most afraid of
click valve attachment
sanding down the parts to get them to fit on the expiratory flow at the ventilator

on pressure control, set at 30, giving each patient about 500
total on the vent is showing 

splitter balance

measuring after Y and not on expiratory branch
colorcoded connections

before or after the Y split-- the orientation is _CRITICAL_
attaching suction to the patient

attachment and detachment needs to be a procedure so that virus doesn't get spewed around

manifold all in one place for patient management
adjusting PEEP, FiO2

weight at the patient
FiO2 the same for all patients (for round 2, maybe adjust?)
PEEP valve

Mapelson C vs Jackson-Rees T (which is F)

Tidal Volume
minute ventilation
breathing rate
blood gas
get rid of carbon dioxide-- controlled with frequency and how big a breath
accept a little higher, but have to get the patient less acidotic
increasing the rate vs tidal volume

control points
PEEP valve-- holds pressure at the ends of expiration
FiO2-- control how much oxygen the patient is getting
Tidal Volume-- total air going in
breathing rate

danger-- traumatize the lungs
oxygen toxicity (only so much they can do, try to get as much PEEP as you can before you crank up the FiO2 to prevent creating free radical oxygen ions

different disease states, different lung compliance
want to be able to see tidal volume and tamp down the flow

(only testing one ventilator)
software change partway

another connection problem with the controller
when using the Campbell valve, need to have a bag or some air reservoir attached so that there's no exposure to the outside air

to discuss: reusability

really a nightmare of connections

allied medical-- some manifold boxes
mixed gas diving manifold
diving supervisor has a console
Ocean Airing

filter out of patient
filter out of expiratory limb of manifold

maybe ethanol with a scrub brush and let it dry
