## Executive Summary

Current medical standard operating procedure requires that patients who become severely ill with COVID-19 be treated using external ventilation.
As the virus spreads, projections suggest that there are not enough ventilators to meet the expected numbers of patients throughout the world.
Project Tetra seeks to create a ventilator splitter so that hospitals inundated with covid-19 patients can effectively increase the number of already available ventilators by up to a factor of 4.
The project aims to produce two versions of the device: one that has been approved by the FDA under the Emergency Use Authorization guidance, and an open source model intended to be made with locally sourced materials.

## Introduction

Introduce your project, including what it does or lets you do, why you would use it, and its primary goal (and how it achieves it). This should be similar to your README description, though you can go into a little more detail here if you want.

## Why do I want it?

Help your user know if your project will help them. Useful information can include: 

* **What is it good for?**: What types of problems does your project solve? What are the benefits of using it?

* **What is it not good for?**: For example, point out situations that might intuitively seem suited for your project, but aren't for some reason. Also mention known limitations, scaling issues, or anything else that might let your users know if the project is not for them.

* **What is it *not yet* good for?**: Highlight any useful features that are coming soon.

## Where should I go next?

Give your users next steps from the Explanations. For example:

## Components in Development
* 3WayOring
  * Rev 8 is latest. 4 parts, 3 from rigid plastic, one from TPE.
* Splitter (likey to require 2, one for expiratory flow, one for inspiratory flow)
  * 4WayVent_3DP_v05.stl is latest 4 way
  * 2WayVent_3DP_v05.stl is latest 2 way
* One Way Valve
  * 2OWV.STL is the latest, requires a flexible seal (silicone molded, printed TPU or cut material/rubber glove)
