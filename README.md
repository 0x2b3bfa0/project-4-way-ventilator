TEST RESULTS NEEDED

dimensions of tubing, if they fit

strength

flow

test with different lung sizes and compliances

flow rates to diff patients

TO DESIGN ensure fittings are ISO

device at the mouth to measure tidal flow, pressure,tidal volume

antiviral & antibacterial filter - integrated into design but not essential for operation

regulator of max pressure into lungs

PEEP valve connector

3 way splitter


On git with files please create a text/pdf documentation
