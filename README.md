# Helpful Engineers Project Repository for Ventilator Splitter
GitHub for Helpful engineering project. Please look around of you are new. 

* Components in Development
   * 3WayOring 
       * Rev 8 is latest. 4 parts, 3 from rigid plastic, one from TPE.
   * Splitter (likey to require 2, one for expiratory flow, one for inspiratory flow)
       * 4WayVent_3DP_v05.stl is latest 4 way
       * 2WayVent_3DP_v05.stl is latest 2 way
   * One Way Valve
       * 2OWV.STL is the latest, requires a flexible seal (silicone molded, printed TPU or cut material/rubber glove)

MAIN FOCUS:

TEST RESULTS NEEDED

dimensions of tubing, if they fit

strength

flow

test with different lung sizes and compliances

flow rates to diff patients

TO DESIGN ensure fittings are ISO

device at the mouth to measure tidal flow, pressure,tidal volume

antiviral & antibacterial filter - integrated into design but not essential for operation

regulator of max pressure into lungs

PEEP valve connector

3 way splitter

On git with files please create a text/pdf documentation

Thread specs: ALL IN 3/8" NPT PLEASE
