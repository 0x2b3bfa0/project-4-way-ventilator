3D printed 3 Way Valve for 22mm/15mm ISO 5356 Respiratory Tubing

## Background

Based on request here: https://helpfulengineering.slack.com/archives/C0103QJMA84/p1584585757410000?thread_ts=1584527911.256500&cid=C0103QJMA84

Valve design created that supports airflow in any 2 of the 3 ports. Utilizes 2 3D printed parts, a M3x6 screw and M3x8 washer.


### Making Valve
