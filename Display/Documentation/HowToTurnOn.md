=============================================

1. Ensure that the splitter is connected to a power supply

2. Ensure that the airlines connecting the splitter and ventillator are attached (detailed in a serperate document)

3. Flip the on-off switch to on

4. After a short boot-up sequence, a screen showing data for each of the patient airlines should appear, which looks like this

   - If instead a computer desktop appears, connect a mouse to the USB port on the splitter and double-click on the "Tetra Splitter Data Readout" icon on the desktop

   - If there is no such icon, ensure that the Tetra Ventillator Splitter software is installed

5. Verify that all the air connections are good

   1. Plug in a patient tube to port 1

   2. Begin breathing through that patient tube

   3. The numbers on column 1 of the Tubing Data Information Screen should be changing

      - If the numbers are not changing, make sure the stop valve for that port is open

   4. Turn the knobs on the control valves for that port.  The PIP and PEEP values should change with them

      - If they aren't changing, ensure all the pneumatic connections are made and tight

   5. Repeat substeps 1.-4. for ports 2, 3, and 4

6. Sterilize the patient tube used for testing and begin treating patients
