# Project Title

3D printed Tee Valve for 22mm/15mm ISO 5356 Respiratory Tubing

## Background

This is an iteration of 3WayValve design and is similar as flow can be directed from any port to the other port. Unrestricted flow is from any 90 degree connection. Thru flow is somewhat restricted. It also allows for fully shutting off flow. Utilizes 2 3D printed parts, a M3x6 screw and M3x8 washer.

The T shape of the valve is less confusing than a symmetric 3 way valve. The T offers 2 ports in-line that are the inputs, and a 3rd port that can go to the user.

### Making Valve

Print 1 each of the following parts

* TeeValveBody_v001.stl
* TeeValveCock_v001.stl

Note: 3D printers make parts with varying tolerances, and material can affect the fit.  If fit is too tight, I included 2 parts that are undersized. Need to confirm air leaks are acceptable with these parts. 
* TeeValveCock_v001-undersize 1 (body diameter is undersized by .2 mm)
* TeeValveCock_v001-undersize 2 (body diameter is undersized by .4 mm)
